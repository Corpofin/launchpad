# Launchpad
Scaffold out your next Laravel project with the Caffeinated ecosystem at your fingertips.

### Disclaimers
- This is an opinionated scaffolding using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). I have no plans supporting other frontend or javascript frameworks.
- This is not a content management system (CMS). You will not find a generated admin control panel or any other GUI in terms of managing modules, users, roles, permissions, or themes.

## What's Provided
Launchpad will scaffold out your new Laravel project with sensible defaults for jumpstarting development.
